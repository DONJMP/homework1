## RECOMENDATIONS
By my research Robinhood is definately recomended as it makes it easy for the new comsumer to step into the world of trading and finance.
According to time Magazine Robinhood is arguably one of the best when it comes to making the market more accessible and is commission-free with most trades.
Not everything is perfect, it would also be ideal to make some improvements in certain areas to make it more appealing to its users. some areas that need improvements are. 
#### COSTUMER SUPPORT
  As a great and recomended platform Robinhood still falls short when compared to other trading platforms and should improve in certain areas like  
   customer support where they have made noticeable improvements but it’s still not on par with other brokerages.
#### RELIABILITY 
  Robinhood has received criticism for untimely outages and trade restrictions amid market volatility, and has been charged by regulators for misleading 
   customers, resulting in significant fines.
#### EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS
   They should offer Echange-traded funds function similarly to mutual funds in that they allow you to gain exposure to a number of different companies by making a single investment. 


One of the main areas that would need improvement is offering costumer service is by adding a more complete automated phone service since it would make it 
easier and faster for some costumers to get the answers they need. Some providers offer good tech for example:
